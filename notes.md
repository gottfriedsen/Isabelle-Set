### Existing Examples

* naturals -> integers
* lists (broken)
* matrices (no transfer needed)

### New Examples

* integers -> polynomials over integers (actually formal power series)
* integers -> rationals -> polynomials over rationals (actually formal power series)
* option a -> list a
* option a -> sum unit a

### Set Specific Problems for Transfer

* translation between set-membership and types
* translation of polymorphic constants
